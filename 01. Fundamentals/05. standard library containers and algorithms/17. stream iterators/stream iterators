stream iterators allow to use streams as a source to read elements from or as 
a destination to write elements to:
- IStream: reads elements from an input stream
- OStream: writes values to an output stream

because there's no container in this case, the end() method cannot be called to
get the end iterator. a default constructed stream iterator counts as the end of
any stream range.
