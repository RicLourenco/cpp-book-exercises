associative containers are containers that allow fast lookup of elements

elements always kept in sorted order

the <functional> header contains objects that can be used to sort
the associative containers

associative containers:
    set: container in which elements are sorted according to their values;
    elements are all distinct values

    multiset: same as set, but duplicates are allowed

    map: containers in which elements are mapped as key-value pairs,
    sorted by key values; each key may occur only once

    multimap: same as map, but the keys can be duplicated

typically associative containers are implemented as variations of binary
trees, providing fast element lookup by exploiting the logarithmic
complexity of the underlying structure
