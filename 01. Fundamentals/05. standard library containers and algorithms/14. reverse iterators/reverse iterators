sometimes it's useful to iterate through a collection of elements in
reverse order. a rverse iterator wraps a bidirectional iterator and swaps
the increment and decrement operations.

the range of a container can be reversed by calling the following methods
on it:
- rbegin(): returns the position of the last element of the container
- rend(): returns the position of the first element of the container

code that works on a normal iterator also works on a reverse iterator
