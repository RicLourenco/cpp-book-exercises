also called inserters, are used to insert new values into containers rather
than overwrite them. there are three types of inserters, which differ on the
position in the container at which they insert elements

categories:
- back inserter: appends a value at the end of the container by calling the
push_back() function
- front inserter: inserts a value at the beginning of the container by calling
the push_front() function
- general inserts: inserts a value at a provided position of the container by
calling the insert() function

some algorithms require an iterator for storing data. insert iterator are
usually used in such cases
