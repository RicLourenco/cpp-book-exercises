polymorphism means many forms and represents the ability of objects to behave
in different ways

templates are a kind of pattern called static polymorphism, static because it's
known at compile time. c++ also supports dynamic polymorphism - having the
behavior of methods change while the program is running. This is powerful
because we can react to information we obtain only after we have compiled our
program, such as user input, values in configurations, or the kind of hardware
the code is running on. This is possible thanks to two features - dynamic
binding and dynamic dispatch.
