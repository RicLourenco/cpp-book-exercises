C++ has three data types which we can use to store specific items such as List,
SinglyLinkedList, and DoublyLinkedList. std::vector can be used as List,
std::forward_list can be used as SinglyLinkedList, and std::list can be used as
DoublyLinkedList. They both have fetching, inserting, searching, and removing
operations. However, the method names they have are different with our developed
data type, and we are going to discuss this in this section. In this section, we
are going to discuss std::vector and std::list only, since std::forward_list is
similar to std::list
